# TIC TAC TOE


#### A Game For The Young At Heart

*Work on this project has slowed or stopped completely. Deadline 3/09/2021, 9pm MST.*

## Technologies Used

* `javaScript`
* `CSS`
* `HTML`

## Learning Goals

* Apply *SRP* and *DRY* `javascript`
* Ensure `localStorage` persists data
* Use `event delegation` to handle similar
* Implement practical understanding of the difference between the `data model` and the `DOM` display
* Iterate through elements with `for loops`
* Solo logic working with vanilla `javaScript`

## Overview

* We all need time to remember to play.  This project allows me to build a game I played as a child. The goal of the project landed most heavily on the experience of creating logic to filter through the choices on the game board.  `localStorage` will be used to hold onto the user's wins.

## Set-up

* Clone this repo to your local computer
* Open in your text editor
* Read the README.md
* In the terminal run the command `open index.html` for initial deployment and interaction with app

## Project Link

## Contributor

## Functionality Goals

* Basic `JSON` and `localStorage` architecture in place inside the `Class` structure of a `data model` to best utilize `javaScript` to manage user experience of holding onto their game scores.
* Strict distinction between updating the `data model` within its `Class` file and manipulation of `DOM` elements
* The users should be able to play through a whole game and both achieve and track wins, as well as ties.
* The whole game should be functional all the way through with no bugs.

## Road Map

##### Future Iterations should include:

* A log in page
* The ability to choose an icon or token for a player name
* As well as saved game boards displaying past wins, as well as a message that lets the user know when a board has been saved
* CSS stylings to increase user experience of joy
* Error handling to offer helpful hints when a user has run into commonly experienced issues
